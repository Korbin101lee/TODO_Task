This is a project i made myself, It uses linked lists to add in tasks to do with a Linked list to add in the time you want the task to be completed by with a description of the task. It allows you to edit if the task is completed with the completed time. It also allows you to Delete tasks and display all the tasks. You can also search the task with the task name.

ToDo
add a save and load feature from a txt file where the Linked List is saved. Would also be cool to implemenet this to do this on the cloud.
